# Encryption lab work
A lab work using RSA algorithm and SHA256 for encrypted messaging using chat application.


## Usage example
1. Start the my_server.py
2. In case of using the same host as server for client just start the my_client.py
In case of using another machine put in SERVER_HOST your local ip and then start my_client.py
3. After connecting to server, type your username, and you ready to chat using encrypted methods
3. By default it's possible up to 5 simultanious connections to server
